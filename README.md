Fraud Detection Analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the fraud detection analysis is to predict anonymized credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine.<br>
The steps involved in the project are:

1. Exploring the dataset.

2. Handling Missing Values

3. Splitting testing and training data, Feature Scaling

4. Decision Tree Classification

5. Random Forest Classification

6. Analysis outcome.

Final result of analysis:

Decision Tree Accuracy : 99.9227549788 <br>
Random Forest Accuracy : 99.9311817084
